# *__Git rebase__*

Push the changes by typing “git push <remote><branch>”, If the branch isn’t out of date, then the changes will push straight up to your github repo, If it is out of date however, you will have to rebase.

The point in rebasing is incase someone commits a change and then your branch is behind, it will merge the changes added to the repo and your changes also. “Git rebase” is the command for this.

#####If you do have to rebase, you will be presented with 3 options :
```sh
git rebase --continue
git rebase --skip
git rebase --abort
```
**git rebase --continue** : used when there are no conflicts or the conflicts are solved.
**git rebase --skip** : skips the file and won't be involved in the rebase.
**git rebase --abort** : kills the process completely, allowing you to start again.
